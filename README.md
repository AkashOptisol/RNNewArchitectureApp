# React Native New Architecture Sample

This repo contains several branches that will help you understand how to setup your project for the **React Native New Architecture**. This should considered as a support material of [the official migration guide](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/pull/2879).

Here you will find **runs of the migration guide** on empty projects. Every commit is **documented** and allows to follow over on every step. 

Please find a list of the branches below, with more information on which kind of setup they're addressing.
